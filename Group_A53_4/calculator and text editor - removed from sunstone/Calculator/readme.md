To design a uniform front-end code for a calculator, you need to consider the following factors:

User Interface: The user interface should be simple and easy to use. It should be designed in such a way that the user can easily input numbers and perform calculations. The design should also be visually appealing and consistent with the overall theme of the website or application.

Layout: The layout of the calculator should be logical and intuitive. The buttons should be arranged in a way that is easy to understand and use. You can group the buttons into categories such as numbers, operations, and other functions.

Functionality: The calculator should be able to perform all basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should also be able to handle decimals, percentages, and other advanced features like memory and scientific notation.

Error handling: The calculator should be able to handle errors such as divide by zero and invalid input. It should provide feedback to the user when an error occurs.

Responsiveness: The calculator should be designed to be responsive to different screen sizes and devices. It should be able to adjust its layout and design to fit the screen size and resolution of the device.

To achieve a uniform front-end code for the calculator, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can create a separate stylesheet for the calculator and use classes and IDs to style the elements. You can also use JavaScript to handle the user input and perform the necessary calculations.

Overall, a uniform front-end code for a calculator should be easy to use, visually appealing, and functionally robust. It should provide a seamless user experience and help users perform calculations quickly and accurately.
